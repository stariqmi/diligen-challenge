Diligen Application Challenge

### Server
The application server is written in Node (es6).

### Client
The UI is written in **React** (es6) and [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/). To make development quicker I used **lodash**, a faster replacement for underscore.js. Ideally I prefer not to use jQuery but for MaterializeCSS, it had to be included. However, the React components do not rely on jQuery.

### Heroku Application

- **Bonus** JSON API endpoint for analyzing document

- Sorting results
- Highlighting results

### Improvements after submission
- Changing color of the word that is highlighted in the table

### Bugs
- **Fixed** Adding "  " i.e 2 or more whitespace characters will be recognized as a word. `9db9e4fe18571e408f88b2fa832f872a0a62061d` `replace(/\s\s+/, '')`
- **Fixed** In case a single word is highlighted, the pair including the single word is not highlighted. `9c33fa4ca8760a5ae7e5736d320aabfc65d6de46`  
- UX: Icon for sorting action missing, clicking on column header works but is not a good UX
